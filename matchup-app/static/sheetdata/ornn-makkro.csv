Items                                                                      Tank items require adapting to the enemy comp as much as possible. Always build towards the biggest threat to you and your team while matching the strength to match the enemy top laner as well. Build optimally so youre strong  at all times and not delaying your build because games end quickly so try to keep yourself and your team alive until you get objectives and start winning fights. ,"Mythics > When and Why?
Radiant Virtue: Very good mythic for Ornn and teamfighting and good team play I build this the most rn. GO RADIANT BEST TANK ITEM IN THE GAME DONT GO JAKSHO                                              Hearsteel: This is propably only good for low elo snowballing if youre already 10x better than the enemy laner, usually you wanna pair this with Doran's Shield > Bamis Cinder > Then you go Heartsteel > Sunfire > Thornmail > Abyssal for MAXIMUM Damage                                                                    Jaksho, The Protean: Solid Ornn Item with good stats BUT RADIANT IS STILL BETTER                                    Iceborn Gauntlet: Very Bad                                         Evenshroud: Very good and very cheap very nice when youre too broke for Radiant Virtue  same thing for Locket the only difference is you build evenshroud for damage and ARMOR/MR for yourself and Locket for team tankiness and ARMOR/MR for them.","Boots
Steelcaps: build when enemy is full AD very rarely tho most of the time Ionians And Swifties are top tier boots
Merc's: build into 3 ap+ users and heavy CC Comps
Sorcerer's Shoes: build vs heavy tanky comps but it's not needed if your team has enough damage.
Ionian Boots: Build when Swifties are bad Ionian boots and swifties should be your main boots
Boots of Swiftness: Good vs slows and some matchups like Sion, Mundo, Illaoi, Malphite
Mobility Boots: When you need to run it down mid","Armour                                     
Sunfire Aegis > Into most bruisers its pretty damn good stats Thornmail: into bruisers and/or need to cut healing
Force of Nature:  into mages and AP heavy champs or if enemy has a lot of hard CC and DOT's (Damage over time spells)
Anathema's Chains: to stop enemy top or ADC from carrying
Warmog's Armour: When you can get in and out of fights easily not good vs poke
Frozen Heart: Into fast champs with quick attack speeds
Winter's Approach: VS boring tank or proxy matchups eg. Garen,Poppy etc.
Abyssal Mask: For Ornn decent because the components but its a little expensive and less tanky then gargoyle when it comes to raw stats so               Gargoyle Stoneplate: Build into teams that have a lot of mixed damage second or third item. REALLY GOOD on Ornn due to his passive                                                                                                                                                                 Knights Vow, Zekes Covergence, Redemption: Build when you have a hypercarry comp like a jinx, vayne setup so you keep the carry alive                                                                                                              Spirit Visage: When you have a yummi or soraka EGIRL with you  Anathema's Chains: Good if they have only 1 AP or AD threat ","4th Items > adapt to comps
Randuin's Omen > Into Crit 
Knight's Vow > To protect your squishy damage dealers
Frozen Heart > To slow enemy fast attackers

Frozen Heart does not counter Master Yi or Olaf or Jhin or affect them in any way shape or form because they can ignore all types of slows with their ults including attack speed slows. Vs Master Yi Instead build Randuin's Omen vs. Crit Build and Thornmail vs On-hit Build. Any immunity that functions the same as Master Yi and Olaf ignores Frozen Heart. Jhin doesnt get his AD reduced from Frozen Heart because it slows attack speed and his attack speed converts into AD but it doesnt work just go randuins vs Jhin.",
Secret Ornn Tips                                                    #1 Use your passive as bait to trade with the enemy top laner                                                                   #2 Use your Q like an Anivia Wall to Zone in fights and not for 70 damage or a slow                                                                                       #3 Build HP items in lane when youre at a high % of health because the higher hp you are the more value you get out of the health item for example if youre at 50% hp a ruby crystal will only give 75 HP so potion and wait until the full duration of the potion goes through THEN buy the HP item.                                                                                       #4 Dont forget to use terrain other than Q for knockups in teamfights                                                               #5 Never fight a lost teamfight save yourself and let the team die if the fight is lost                                                                                                                                                                                                                  #7 Get to level 13 ASAP and 14>17 are your upgrades so use them on the most compotent player you have on your team                                                                                                                         #8 You can use R1 E R2  Together so you basically use your E to gap close to your R2 so you can cast it faster and closer                                                                                                               ,"Masterwork Upgrade Priority

Pretty much all of ornn matchups after 6 go like this: if hit q then ult instantly and e and put them in a true combo and beat the fuck out of them with your tripple brittle combo. Be wary of enemy junglers at all times you ARE ORNN and will BE WEAKSIDE a lot so prepare your mind and body for the lane of pain and suffering. You powerspike at level 6 and when you max your W rank and at level 13>17 when you get your Mythic Upgrades with bonus stats.

W > E > Q: Into bruiser melees or if the enemy top seems to have really good movement and dodges your Qs
3 Points Q > W > E > Finish Q So you basically only put 3 points into Q and proceed to max W and then E and finish Q when youre level 17/18 because theres no more value in maxing Q past 3 Points              1 Adaptive Force when leveling Q: Into squishy ranged champs, squishy melees, or lanes where you need to stay safe and poke.                                                    Max W first if the enemy is dodging your Q's easily and have unpredictable movements.                                                           Never E Max First.

Buy Sweeper/Farsight Alteration at lvl 9 to help clearing vision and frontline and clearing vision for team if ahead/even and scouting if behind with blue trinket. 

On first back, Always buy a Refillable Potion and Control Ward on first back to be safe from ganks. Executioner into AP Healers and Champions that ignore you by not auto attacking in fights. Buy Bramble Vest vs AD Healers/Auto Attackers. Wardens If they auto a lot and dont heal that much. Turn the wardens into A: Frozen Heart if theyre auto attacker B: Randuins if they crit.. FROZEN HEART/RANDUINS/THORNMAIL/SUNFIRE AEGIS GOOD FIRST ITEM VS AD LANERS. GO Bamis Cinder INTO MELEES, CAN SKIP IT IF THEYRE MELEES THAT YOU CANT FIGHT IN LONG TRADES, SKIP IT ALWAYS INTO RANGED MATCHUPS. Sit on Magical Footwear DONT BUY BOOTS UNTIL 3 ITEMS OR IF YOURE ALREADY TANKY ENOUGH. WARNING ABOUT ABYSSAL RUSH ONLY GO IT WHEN THEY HAVE 2 AP TOP/JGL or TOP/MID and a low damage tank JGL otherwise build Radiant Virtue and for more MR build GARGOYLE. THE MATCHUP SHEET IS JUST A SUGGESTION OF WHATS MOST OPTIMAL INTO THE MATCHUP IN AN ISOLATED SITUTATION ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THE ENEMY TEAM THREATS. Most of the time you wont need to rush Abyssal and Gargoyle will provide WAYYYY more tankiness so keep that in mind",How hard is the Matchup to learn is measured in this diffculty column. Some difficulties might change over time because riot like to shift top laners strength over time but it should be about right.,Some insights into how to play the matchup and general special interactions that you might not notice. Some comments might be outdated so if you have questions either look at my accounts or ask me on discord. The general idea of most Ornn matchups is poke them down with Q > W > E until they are low enough for you to do the sacred Triple Brittle Combo. Make sure they have no dashes left when doing this combo or else they will dodge the E. The Combo is Q > R > E > R > Auto > W > Auto. You can throw another auto in to make it optimal like this Q > R > E > Auto > R > Auto > W > Auto but thats not for begginers and highly inconsistent so stick to the one above. So again you poke and poke until theyre low enough to full combo and you build towards your spikes and teamfight around level 12-14.   My OPGGS >> All My High Elo Accounts

Try to all in when you have 2 Items Spike you're stronger than him at that point. Make sure you healcut him in Teamfights and EZ Win. KILL HIM AT ALL COST KILL KILLL. This matchup is really hard and you must rely on poking him down slowly when hes aboout 60% HP or 50% HP. At that point you can maybe kill him but if hes higher than that keep poking with Q W and E away from his Qs and combos."
